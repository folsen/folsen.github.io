I'm an Engineering Physics student at [LTH](http://www.lth.se/english) and I'm extremely passionate about learning. I love challenges. The time I don't spend in school I spend on working one some new fun project of my own creation or working with [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) on some larger projects.

I have recently gotten into [Cappuccino](http://cappuccino.org) and love the concept, I love the web and have spent the last 15 years of my life trying to approve it and I think [Cappuccino](http://cappuccino.org) is a large step in the right direction.

I also code a little Objective-C for the iPhone.

When I'm not coding I create [puzzle-hunts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_hunt), that is one of my other big passions. I am half of the team creating the i-Hunt at the British event [i-Series](http://iseries.multiplay.co.uk/) and The DreamHack Game at [DreamHack](http://dreamhack.se).
